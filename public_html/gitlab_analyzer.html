Having a strong organizational skills and an enthusiasm for UI/UX design, I took initiative and turned the team's brainstormed ideas to a Figma prototype in order for us to better visualize the application.</p><figure><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_requirements.png" width="1026" height="946" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project requirements"><figcaption>I turned this long and abstract requirement document...</figcaption></figure><figure class="last-item"><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_initial_prototype.png" width="1432" height="677" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project initial prototype"><figcaption>...into this initial interactive prototype.</figcaption></figure></figure><p>This was a rough prototype that captured the basic application's functionalities, and gave us the team a possible flow of the application. After proposing this Figma prototype, I was trusted by my team to be <strong>the gate-keeper of the application's overall UI design</strong> (Yay!).</p></section><section class="project-info" id="implementation"><h2>Implementation</h2><p>With the Figma mockup at hand as a basis, the team started to work on the actual implementation of the application. After a couple of weeks, we had an iteration checkpoint with the customer for reviews.</p><p>The customer gave our team very informative feedbacks, after which I adjusted the Figma mockup to reflect the changes.</p><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_DesignSystem.png" width="873" height="583" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project - Our team's design system on Figma"><figcaption>I started with updating the design system for our team, and this is the final version of the design system.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the feedbacks we received from the customer was that they want the app navigation bar to always be present on the screen without the user having to toggle to open and close it.</p><figure><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_ClosedNav.png" width="1440" height="1024" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project - Merge Request page preview with navigation bar closed"><figcaption>1) A page with navigation bar closed</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_OpenNav.png" width="1440" height="1024" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project - Merge Request page preview with navigation bar open"><figcaption>2) A page with navigation bar open</figcaption></figure><figcaption>Before the feedbacks, the navigation bar has to be toggled to close and open</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_NewNavBar.png" width="1440" height="1024" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project - Merge Request page preview with navigation bar always on the screen without having to toggle"><figcaption>Now, merge Request page preview with navigation bar always on the screen without having to toggle</figcaption></figure><figure><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_ClusteredInfoForMR.png" width="1373" height="712" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project - Merge Request page preview with clustered display of information"><figcaption>1) Clustered display of information</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_CleanDisplayInfoForMR.png" width="1373" height="712" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project - Merge Request page preview with clean display of information"><figcaption>2) A cleaner display of information</figcaption></figure><figcaption>The display of information about a merge request was adjusted based on the customer's feedbacks: The clustered information in one column is now shown nicely in two columns.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_refined_prototype.png" width="1440" height="677" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project - Refined prototype on Figma"><figcaption>Refined prototype based on the customer's feedbacks.</figcaption></figure></section><section class="project-info" id="challenge"><h2>Challenge</h2><p>Beside being the gate-keeper of the UI/UX design of our application, I was a part of the front-end team. The actual application was built using <em>React</em> framework for the front-end, and <em>Node.js</em> and <em>Express.js</em> for the back-end development. Having no previous experience with web concepts, let alone using the tools and frameworks for development, I had little involvement in using the mentioned frameworks and had to picked up the necessary skills quickly to catch up with my other team members.</p><p>I admittedly was overwhelmed at first, but luckily, my teammates were really understanding and helped me out a lot with learning React. By the end of the project, I managed to implement a full page of the application by myself from start to finish, successfully getting around to retrieving GitLab merge requests' and issues' notes (or comments) through GitLab API, saving the data in the database, and implementing React components to display the content on the page.</p><figure><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_MergeRequestNotes.png" width="1422" height="732" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project - Preview of the Comment page with the list of comments left by developers on merge requests in a repository."><figcaption>1) Displaying comments left on all merge requests in a repository</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_IssueNotes.png" width="1422" height="732" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project - Preview of the Comment page with the list of comments left by developers on issues in a repository."><figcaption>2) Displaying comments left on all issues in a repository</figcaption></figure><figcaption>The comment page of the application implemented by me.</figcaption></figure></section><section class="project-info" id="result"><h2>Result</h2><p>There were 7 teams in total who worked on this GitLab Iteration Analyzer web application, with the same specifications and requirements, but only one team's product would be chosen by the customer to progress to continued development and would be put into active use in the future.
