It is also an opportunity for students to walk through the whole process of developing an application from start to the end, including requirement analysis, application design and implementation, as well as testing and deployment, while working on a product that would be delivered to the real customer at the end of the course.</p></section><section id="analyze"><h2>Requirement Analysis</h2><p>Upon receiving the requirement documents and specifications from the customer, our team had a meeting to analyze and break down the requirements into features for the application. With UI/UX design being my liking, I took initiative and offered to turned the features that we were still brainstorming to a Figma prototype in order for us to better visualize the application's flow.</p></section><section id="implementation"><h2>Implementation</h2><p>Having the Figma prototype that I created, the team started to implement the actual application, which was built using Node.js and Express.js for back-end development, and React.js for the front-end development. After a couple of weeks, we had a meeting with the customer for reviews and feedbacks, upon which I adjusted the Figma prototype to reflect the changes.</p></section><section id="challenge"><h2>Challenge</h2><p>Beside being the gate-keeper of the UI/UX design of our application, I was a part of the front-end team. Having no previous experience with web development, let alone using React, I had little experience with both the framework and the technical concepts of the web itself, I had to picked up the necessary skills quickly to catch up with my other team members. Luckily, my teammates were really understanding and helped me out a lot with learning React, so by the end of the project, I could have implemented a full page of the application by myself, from the working with the GitLab API to save data in the database, to passing data to the front end and implementing React components to display the content on the page.</p></section><section id="result"><h2>result</h2></section></body></html>
