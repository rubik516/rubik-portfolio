Having a strong organizational skills and an enthusiasm for UI/UX design, I took initiative and turned the team's brainstormed ideas to a Figma prototype in order for us to better visualize the application.</p><figure><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_requirements.png" width="1026" height="946" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project requirements"><figcaption>I turned this long and abstract requirement document...</figcaption></figure><figure class="last-item"><img src="img/GitLabAnalyzer_initial_prototype.png" width="1432" height="677" alt="GitLab Iteration Analyzer project initial prototype"><figcaption>...into this initial interactive prototype.</figcaption></figure><p>This was a rough prototype that captured the basic application's functionalities, and gave us the team a possible flow of the application. After proposing this Figma prototype, I was trusted by my team to be <strong>the gate-keeper of the application's overall UI design</strong> (Yay!).</p></section><section class="project-info" id="implementation"><h2>Implementation</h2><p>The actual application was built using <em>React</em> framework for the front-end, and <em>Node.js</em> and <em>Express.js</em> for back-end. After a couple of weeks, we had a meeting with the customer for reviews and feedbacks, upon which I adjusted the Figma prototype to reflect the changes.</p></section><section class="project-info" id="challenge"><h2>Challenge</h2><p>Beside being the gate-keeper of the UI/UX design of our application, I was a part of the front-end team. Having no previous experience with web development, let alone using React, I had little experience with both the framework and the technical concepts of the web itself, I had to picked up the necessary skills quickly to catch up with my other team members. Luckily, my teammates were really understanding and helped me out a lot with learning React, so by the end of the project, I could have implemented a full page of the application by myself, from the working with the GitLab API to save data in the database, to passing data to the front end and implementing React components to display the content on the page.</p></section><section class="project-info" id="result"><h2>Result</h2></section></main><footer><p>This website uses <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik">Rubik</a> font from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a></p></footer></body></html>
