            h2 Hi there, Iâ€™m Celine.
            
            p I am a student web designer and developer based in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Having a keen interest in creating for the web, I enjoy building accessible and responsive websites. I care about making a website functional, reliable and usable at its core, with a convenient content design that pleases and elevates the experience of the people who are interacting with it, while having a stunning original look on its surface is a great plus.
            
            p As a strong believer that only good websites can stand out in the World Wide Web and stay longer in the journey, I love seeking to understand what factors contribute to a good website that attracts people to come back, rather than just a one-time piece of technology that escapes their mind with ease and is consigned to oblivion.
